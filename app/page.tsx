          Every story about the past is shaped by those who tell it. The way we
          dig, interpret, and share history is never neutral—our assumptions,
          perspectives, and even the questions we ask influence the results.
          This is <strong>bias in archaeology</strong>. It's not always obvious,
          but it shapes what we see and what remains hidden.

          A Journey into the Past—And Ourselves
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Imagine you are standing at the edge of an ancient site. You have a
          trowel in one hand, a notebook in the other. Every layer you uncover
          tells a story, but whose story is it? Who decided which objects are
          important? Who named the artefacts? And who got left out of the
          narrative?
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          <strong>
            Bias isn't about getting things wrong—it's about understanding why
            we see things the way we do.
          </strong>{' '}
          And just like archaeology itself, recognising bias isn't about finding
          a final answer. It's about constantly questioning, refining, and
          expanding what we know.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">What Is Bias?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Bias isn't just personal opinion—it's the framework we use to make
          sense of the world. Some biases come from cultural perspectives,
          historical records, or the limits of scientific tools. Others are
          shaped by funding, politics, or even which sites are excavated in the
          first place.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          In archaeology, bias can mean{' '}
          <strong>overlooking certain communities</strong>,
          <strong>misinterpreting artefacts</strong>, or{' '}
          <strong>reinforcing outdated ideas</strong>. It can also shape how the
          public sees the past—through museums, films, or news headlines.

        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          This project is a{' '}
          <strong>place to explore how bias shapes archaeology</strong>—not to
          criticise, but to <strong>ask better questions</strong>. It is a
          resource for archaeologists, teachers, and anyone curious about how
          history is written.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          You will find <strong>case studies</strong>,{' '}
          <strong>myths vs. reality comparisons</strong>, and
          <strong>practical ways</strong> to identify bias in research and
          public narratives. Whether you are a professional, a student, or
          simply interested in history, this site is here to help you see
          archaeology—and the past—with new eyes.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why Does This Matter?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Archaeology is about more than objects in the ground—it's about{' '}
          <strong>
            the people who lived before us and the way we understand them
          </strong>
          . Recognising bias doesn't mean archaeology is flawed; it means it's
          evolving. New perspectives bring <strong>new stories</strong>, and new
          stories bring <strong>a richer, more complete history</strong>.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          And this is where you come in. By questioning how we see the past, you
          become part of a conversation that shapes the future of archaeology.
