          About The Archaeology of Bias
        </h1>
        <p className="text-lg max-w-2xl mx-auto mb-8">
          Archaeology tells the story of our past, but stories are shaped by the
          perspectives of those who tell them. What we find, how we interpret
          it, and even the questions we ask—everything is influenced by bias.
          <strong>The Archaeology of Bias</strong> is a project that explores
          these biases, making them visible, understandable, and open to
          discussion.

          What is Bias in Archaeology?
        </h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          Bias is not just personal opinion—it is the lens through which we see
          the world. It influences decisions, from which sites are excavated to
          how artefacts are interpreted. Some biases come from history, culture,
          or limited evidence. Others are shaped by funding, politics, or the
          way archaeology is presented in the media.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          <strong>Bias is not always intentional</strong>, but it affects what
          we know about the past. Recognising it does not weaken archaeology—it
          makes it stronger. By understanding where biases come from, we can ask
          better questions, find new perspectives, and tell a fuller story of
          human history.

        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-4">Why This Project?</h2>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          The idea behind <strong>The Archaeology of Bias</strong> came from a
          simple realisation: many of the biggest debates in archaeology are not
          just about discoveries, but about <em>how</em> we interpret them.
        </p>
        <p className="text-lg mb-6">
          This project exists to provide{' '}
          <strong>clear, research-based explanations</strong> of how bias shapes
          archaeology. It is not about discrediting the discipline—it is about
          improving it by making its limitations visible and showing how it
          evolves with new knowledge.
